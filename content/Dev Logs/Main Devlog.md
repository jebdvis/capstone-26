title: Main Devlog
---
## January 9, 2026
I've spent my time today for the most part trying to set up this very devlog to show up on my Github website. It's showing up but being a bit squirrelly on showing up, I think it has something to do with the Quartz building that it's using. ANYWAYS, I also have to work on this project instead of procrastinating with things that relate to the project but aren't actually the project and with that I've got some goals to reach before next week:
### Week 1 Goals
- Component system to attach abilities/effects to paths/path points
	- At least one ability/effect to accompany, but want to have 2 or 3
- Test component system as it's constructed as well as for general feel for game
- Ideation on visual styling for visual redesign
- The framework that the abilities that don't exist on the puzzle will exist
	- How will the time manipulation, redshift/blueshift, and spaghettification work

### Project Milestones
#### 30% project complete mark
#### 50% project complete mark
#### 90% project complete mark 
#### 100% project complete mark
## January 6, 2026
Only a matter of days before the reckoning. In 2 days, the end of the beginning. At 9 AM will be the first Capstone Projects class. And I want to have organized what I have done currently and what I will start working on this Thursday! My time management over break for this project was god awful, but I needed a bit more of a break to make sure I wasn't gonna burn out too much. After my rest of watching movies and shows, listening to music, playing games, I'm ready to get back into this project. I want to make sure I have a good time management for this project, mostly because I'm kinda bad about doing work when I'm along, probably cause of that ol ADHD, but I want to give myself the tools and resources to keep myself accountable for this project and others.

### What I have:
- Rough Player Controller
- Visual Test Scene in Godot(Deprecated)
- Visual Test in Blender(Deprecated)
- Audio Test(Music) in Ableton
- Storyboard on "Gameloops"
- Puzzle Design in Progress(Done Over Break)
	- 3D shapes that the player manipulates to have a puzzle object follow the paths
	- Possibly using different shapes besides squares
	- Brainstorm on mechanics of paths, shifting towards abilities/effects that relate to blackhole:![[Screenshot 2026-01-06 at 1.50.33 PM.png]]
- Basic Mechanics of Puzzle Implemented(Done Over Break)
	- Moving puzzle object on paths
	- Giving abilities/effects on paths(WIP)

### Next Steps:
- <u>**ORGANIZE FOLDERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**</u>
- Playtest systems
	- Test control schemes for moving puzzles, currently using a joystick and triggers to control the 3 axes 
- Play around with basic layouts for puzzles
	- Puzzles that don't require the abilities/effects
	- Puzzles that help the player learn the base mechanics
- Create system to attach abilities/effects to rails
	- Maybe implement as player controlled, not just when on specific rail
- **KEEP TESTING AS THINGS ARE MADE**
#### Less Priority
- Visual Rework
	- I Like What This Guy is Doing  --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfipwefB0Ac
- Test Room Blockout
- Way to make puzzles in Blender
	- Was working on a way to lay out empties in Blender and then having a script in Godot draw paths between those empties. Currently not working because I'm detecting if a path can be drawn between empties with a raycast detecting empty space between those empty points, but the detection is failing at the moment
